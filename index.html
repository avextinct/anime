                <p><i><strong>Black Clover</strong> (TV Series 2017–2021) Dubbed by <a href="https://www.funimation.com">Funanimation</a></i></p>
                <p>Everyone within the Clover Kingdom is born with the natural ability to perform magic. Asta and Yuno are both orphans, abandoned at the same church at the same time, and the two have become inseparable throughout their childhood. Asta dreams of becoming the greatest and most powerful mage in the Kingdom. There's only one problem: Asta can't use any magic. Yuno has always been good with magic -- a genius even -- and has great control over it, which becomes evident to Asta, who works to train physically to make up for his lack of magic. As teenagers, Asta and Yuno are chosen to become Magic Knights. Yuno receives his grimoire with the power of wind while Asta does not. When their lives are threatened, Asta manages to summon his own grimoire, one that has a very rare and mysterious anti-magic ability. "Black Clover" follows Asta and Yuno within their respective squads as they continue to show a friendly rivalry that has them both striving to become the next Wizard King.</p></td>
